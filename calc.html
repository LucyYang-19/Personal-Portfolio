	While learning more about JavaScript, the class was assigned to create a functioning calculator. During the creation of the calculator, we used Github to maintain a repository over different browsers and Visual Studio Code to program and create the calculator. 
	Using Mozilla as reference, we were able to design and create a functioning calculator. While creating this calculator, we learned how to use and connect forms (buttons and input) to the html or css file. This mini-project gave us a small peek into how using JavaScript would be like and how we would make use of the form objects. 
	Before turning in this calculator, I wish I was able to finish it completely. It was only half functioning, like I was able to delete, input equations, and clear the calculator, but I wasn’t able to actually calculate anything. Some of those things were also the successes I had while making the calculator. On the day it was due, I was able to clear, delete, and input equations into the calculator, of course with the help of Mr. Fast, but I wasn’t able to calculate it. I knew how to fix it, just not how to go about it and so I ended up fixing it later. 
	When we were first assigned to do the calculators, I had no idea on how to go about it and so I ended up collaborating with Jade and Brandon in order to obtain a stronger foundation. After, I continued investigating different ways on how to make the calculator actually work, even then I ended up going to Mr. Fast for help again. Upon searching for a while, I definitely had to persist because there were definitely times where I wanted to give up so much. After completing the calculator to the best of my ability, I reflected and occasionally went back to see how I could or could have improved it.
