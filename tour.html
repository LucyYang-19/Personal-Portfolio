        In the beginning of the second semester, I was assigned to a group of three to design and create a tourism website which we called Nectar. During the creation of this website, we used Figma to wireframe the website, Github to share a repository, Photoshop to create and render our images, and Visual Studio Code to program and create the actual website. The website included information on three different countries that had three pages each. On each of the three pages were information about them like their history, cultures, where they were located, how one can get there, and different holidays significant to that region.
        Using professional websites as reference, we were able to design and create our website. Using Photoshop, we learned how to render down the images so they wouldn’t take over 10 seconds to load and then uploaded them onto our website using Visual Studio Code. Additionally, we included text on our website explaining more about the different countries we had which were China, Korea, and Canada. The writing was proofread and the images were splash free which meant they were free-use.
        Although I was proud of the website we created, I do wish it were completed and polished. Some struggles we had while creating this website were that we would use the same names as a variable and when we changed one thing, the whole website had shifted with the change. To overcome that, we had to change the variable name and keep track of which names were already used. Another issue was clashing opinions, sometimes we weren’t always on the same page, but because no one spoke out about their opinions, each of us did our own thing. In the end, we managed to come to a conclusion and make everything uniform. Some successes we had were the color choice and the design of the website. We had agreed on the color scheme relatively quickly since red was a common theme between the three countries we had and the design of the website came easy to us since we didn’t want anything too big. The most time consuming thing about this project was probably writing out the text and programming the website itself. 
        When we were first assigned to our groups, we had to initiate the process of creating our website which was to first investigate other websites for inspiration and start prototyping a wireframe of our website. After having a general idea of how we wanted the website to look like, we had to collaborate with each other to decide on a color scheme to use. Through this project, I had to communicate with the others so that we wouldn’t just go with one idea because one person liked it, we had to collaborate and connect our ideas in order to create a complete thought. There were definitely times through this project where we were frustrated and wanted to give up, especially because having three people work on one website can cause differences in opinions, but regardless of our differences, we were able to persist and finish the website successfully.
