    <div class="intro">	Hello, my name is Lucy Yang, and I will graduate from Buchanan High School in May of  2023. As of right now,  I am attending the Center for Advanced Research and Technology to get the hang of programming and exploring its different stems. Currently, I am enrolled in Web Applications and next year I will be entering Game Design.
        This year in Web Applications, we, as a whole, learned to collaborate and communicate with peers around us in order to complete a task together. One of the major projects we did was a Tourism website. This project highlighted the usage of media inquiries and displayed the history, cultures, holidays, and location of different countries. Another project we are working on is an interactive game story, for this project we are working in groups of 2. An interactive story game basically moves according to the user's choices and can result in different endings. This project is used to highlight the usage of JavaScript and the way it can make a website interactive.  Over at my home school, I volunteer alongside my clubs like creating stockings for Christmas or serving as a waiter for a Crab Fest, and on my days off, I occasionally would work jobs from my aunt. 
        Growing up, I have always had pets like fishes, dogs, cats, and hamsters, so I am a big animal lover. I love spending time with family, having close connections with them gives me a place to call home. Lastly, in my free time I like to game, browse the internet, and read.
        You have reached the end of my ‘About Me’ page, on my website I have other resources available like my resume, work samples, and contact information. Feel free to explore more on my portfolio and connect with me.
