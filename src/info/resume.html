To Whom It May Concern:

I am enthusiastically writing this letter of recommendation on behalf of Lucy Yang for any technical roles
she chooses to pursue.

During her time at Buchanan High School, Lucy has maintained high grades in all of her classes through
hard work and consistency, and she has has shown her teachers, peers, and family that she is one of the
brightest and most driven young minds in her class. Her interest in STEM is strong, especially in software
development and information technology, and she spends much of her free time honing her skills in
these areas.

Lucy has shown time and time again that she is dedicated, inquisitive, and teachable; she will no doubt
make a phenomenal engineer in the software industry once she finishes her studies. During the time
that I have known her, she has strived for excellence in every endeavor that she has undertaken,
whether it be a personal or academic goal. I have every reason to believe she will find much success in
her future.

Sincerely,

Vishal Gorawala
Cybersecurity Analyst
