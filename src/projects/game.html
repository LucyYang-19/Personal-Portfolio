            <pre>
                  
                Towards the start of the second semester, we were given a partner and assigned to create an Interactive Game Story. Before starting the
            website, we used Lucid Charts to create our storyline and branch out our plot. After, we moved the story onto a google doc for a spell
            check and as a final draft of the script. When we started coding the story, we used Github to share a repository and Visual Studio code
            to actually write the code. For the background, we used Photoshop to alter the image. The story code itself was created using JavaScript
            and the rest was HTML and CSS.
                For this project, Solomon and I referenced the code of past Web Development classes in order to get a rough idea of how to get the story 
            options to work. While using Lucid Charts, we found that it would make extending the story branches easier and it made creating the outline a 
            lot easier. Google Doc has a pageless option which came in handy when we were told to move everything from our lucid chart onto the doc
            because that meant we weren’t limited to the small space given, and our text was able to get spell checked. With photoshop, we were able 
            to adjust the background of the home page to the way we wanted it. 
            One of the most successful aspects of this assignment was that we got the story to work, a little after the due date, we were trying to 
            configure out how to alternate the pages. If the alternating pages are up, then that would be the most successful thing about our project.
            A failure were the buttons, they are unevenly spaced especially when they alternate in how many options apply. We will still continue 
            trying to fix these errors, but it is, I would like to say, decent for what it is. We definitely could have done better, especially with
            our time management. 
                The initiation process of this website was going smoothly, Solomon and I were finishing everything on time. Towards the programming part,
            we got a bit lazier, we still put in a lot of effort, but we procrastinated on it a lot. We kept pushing it back when we knew we should have
            gotten to it and our conflicting schedules didn’t help. It took a lot of persistence to actually finish it with the same effort that we 
            started with. When starting to brainstorm, we had a rough idea of what we could do and we ended up combining them to come up with the Legend
            of Dante. Reflecting on it now, there are a lot of things we could’ve done differently, but it isn’t too late, at least not yet. 

                                                                     <a href="https://the-legend-of-dante.netlify.app/">Link To Website</a>
