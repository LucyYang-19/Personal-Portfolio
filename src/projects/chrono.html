	At the beginning of the year, we were assigned to create a Chronoshift website. Our instructions were to create a website to attract people interested in traveling to the past. For this website, I used Photoshop to create the images, Figma to wireframe the website, Netlify to post the website, Google Drive to move the code files from place to place, and Visual Studio Code to program the website. On the Chronoshift website there were four pages. One of the pages, the about page, has information on the staff and more about the company. On the expeditions page, it contains information about places people could travel to and the cost of the trips. On the third page, the policy page, it has the policy agreement that needs to be signed before actually going. The final page, the book now page, includes a form that people can sign to book an expedition and pay. 
	For this website, instead of referencing other websites for inspiration, I pieced it together as I saw fit for the content. For the wireframe I just placed square boxes where I thought they would look nice and then ended up where I’m at now. Using Netlify, I learned how to post my website publicly, and using Visual Studio Code, I programmed my website. This website contains text which we had proofread through google Docs and images that we photoshopped. This time around, we hadn’t rendered them down, so we just posted them as they were. Like all the other websites, the images I used were splash free which just means they’re free-use. 
	Looking back at this website, there are so many things that I can fix, but for being my first website, it isn’t relatively bad. Some challenges I experienced when creating this website was getting the boxes to lay horizontally or vertically and the flex playground. Even now, I wouldn’t say I’m good at it just yet, it’s a work in progress. Another challenge was time, I could take months and I wouldn’t be done with it, I was taking too much time on something relatively simple. Some successes I experienced were getting it done on time. I was proud that I was able to get my policies page done along with the color scheme. Some images on the website aren’t too bad, others have bad quality and are stretched. Overall, I did a decent job for this being my first website. 
	The initiation process of this website was going smoothly, I had things under control. Towards the programming part, the coding part, I wanted to give up so many times. It got frustrating because I couldn’t get the flexbox to work properly, but that was most likely because I wasn't using it properly to begin with. It took a lot of determination and persistence to actually finish it with the same effort I started with. Reflecting on it now, there are a lot of things that I could have done differently. Towards the end of the website building, we each presented our website and got criticism on it. Through the collaboration of the class, we were able to improve it even slightly. In the beginning, I had also referred to my neighbors for a color scheme and wireframe because I am an indecisive person.
